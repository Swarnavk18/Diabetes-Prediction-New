## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is crucial to managing the disease effectively. This system uses machine learning techniques to predict diabetes using health-related features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, etc. 

The system is built using Python and leverages both SVM and Logistic Regression for the classification task.

## Features

- **Multiple Models**: Both Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression algorithms are used for classification.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data normalization, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **User-friendly**: The system can easily be extended or used as a starting point for other medical prediction systems.
- **Evaluation**: Various evaluation metrics are calculated, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-system.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd diabetes-prediction-system
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Add the dataset:
   - Ensure the dataset file (`diabetes.csv`) is placed in the `data/` folder.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   Run the data preprocessing script to clean and normalize the data:
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

2. **Train Models**:
   - To train the SVM model:
     ```bash
     python src/svm_model.py
     ```
   - To train the Logistic Regression model:
     ```bash
     python src/logistic_regression_model.py
     ```

3. **Evaluate Models**:
   After training, the evaluation metrics will be displayed for both models.

4. **Jupyter Notebooks**:
   You can also explore the models interactively using the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.

## Algorithms Used

### 1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by finding a hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes.

### 2. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a statistical model that, in its basic form, uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision**: The proportion of positive predictions that are correct.
- **Recall**: The proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.
- **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix used to visualize the performance of the classification model.

## Results

| Model               | Accuracy |
|---------------------|----------|
| Support Vector Machine | 88.5%    | 
| Logistic Regression   | 88.4%    |
The SVM model outperformed Logistic Regression in terms of overall accuracy.
